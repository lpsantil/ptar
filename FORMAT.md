# Introduction
This is a detailed explanation of the plain text archive (ptar) format.

# Metadata Format
Metadata is plain text.  Archives begin with a block of archive metadata and are followed by zero or more file entries.

Each piece of metadata occupies its own line and has two components: a key and a value.  Keys are case-insensitive and may contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and underscores, but each must begin with a letter or number, which must be the line’s first character.  Values may contain any character except NUL characters and newlines.  Programs that process plain text archives must strip keys of spaces and transform all key characters into their lowercase equivalents.  Thus “`File Size`”, “`F I L E si ze`”, and “`filesize`” are equivalent.  A key is separated from its value by a single colon character (`:`).

Keys other than those specified below are illegal.

# Standard Arhive Metadata Keys

* `Metadata Encoding`: This specifies the archive’s metadata’s character encoding, which must be one of `utf-8` (Unicode octet encoding), `utf8` (a synonym for `utf-8`), or `ascii` (7-bit US-ASCII).  If this key is missing, then `utf-8` is assumed.
* `Archive Creation Date`: This specifies the date the archive was created.  The format is arbitrary: It’s meant to be merely advisory.  However, a nice, standard format is `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`, where `%Y` is the year, `%m` is the month (`00` to `12`), `%d` is the day of the month (`00` to `31`), `%H` is the hour (`00` to `23`), `%M` is the minute (`00` to `59`), and `%S` is the second (`00` to `60`, where `60` is for leap seconds).  In this case, the time is interpreted as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC; Zulu).  This key is not required.
* `Extensions`: This specifies a comma-separated list of names of format extensions used by the archive.  Extension names may contain any character except NUL characters, newlines, and commas.  Programs that process plain text archives must strip extension names of spaces and transforms their characters into their lowercase equivalents.  If this key is missing, then no extensions are present.

# Standard File Entry Metadata Keys

Technical terms appearing here, such as “symbolic link” and “major number,” are standard UNIX/*NIX terms.

* `Path`: the path of the file represented by the file entry, which may be relative or absolute
* `Type`: one of the following self-explanatory, case-insensitive identifiers for the file’s type: `Regular File`, `Directory`, `Symbolic Link`, `Character Device`, `Block Device`, `FIFO`, or `Socket`.
* `File Size`: the size of the file in bytes (decimal; only required for regular files)
* `Link Target`: path to the symbolic link’s target (only required for symbolic links)
* `Major`: the device’s major number (decimal; only required for character and block devices)
* `Minor`: the device’s minor number (decimal; only required for character and block devices)
* `User Name`: the file’s owner’s username
* `User ID`: the file’s owner’s user ID (decimal)
* `Group Name`: the file’s owner’s group name
* `Group ID`: the file’s owner’s group ID (decimal)
* `Permissions`: the file’s access permissions (at least four octal digits)
* `Modification Time`: the time the file’s contents were last changed in seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00 Coordinated Universal Time) (decimal)

NOTE: Unless otherwise specified, all of the aforementioned keys are required.  Keys that do not apply to a file entry are silently ignored.

# Regular File Contents

If a file is a regular file (`Type` is `Regular File`), then the entry’s metadata is immediately followed by a line containing exactly three hyphens (`-`) followed by a newline character, then the file’s contents, then three hyphens followed by a newline character.  File entries must be separated by at least one blank line.  (Blank lines are optional after regular file entries because the final hyphens are implicit entry separators.)

# Filename Extension
Like historical `tar(1)` archives, plain text archives may have any filename extension: Programs that process plain text archives should not expect or require a particular filename extension.  However, `.ptar` is a reasonable and recognizable standard extension.  Unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise, new plain text archives should be named with the `.ptar` filename extension.
